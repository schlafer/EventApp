/*
The UserModel struct contains a DB field, which is a pointer to a sql.DB instance.
The User struct includes four fields: Id, Email, Password, and Name.
json tags are used to define how the struct fields are converted to and from JSON, ensuring proper data serialization and deserialization.
The Password field is marked with a - in the json tag, instructing the JSON package to exclude it from JSON responses, making sure we donâ€™t expose the password in the response.
